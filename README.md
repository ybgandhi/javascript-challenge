## UFO LEVEL 1

## Background
The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

The collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

## Goal
Use JavaScript to populate an HTML table with UFO sighting data, and create an event listener to search through the date column to find rows that match user input.

Process:
* Set up a HTML web page [index.html]
* analyze the UFO Dataset [data.js]
* populate the html table with `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` from the UFO Dateset
* the app.js script first populates the table with a function to fill in the data into their respective rows and columns
* the script is also enabled with an event listener function which activated when the user enters and clicks to filter the table by a certain date
